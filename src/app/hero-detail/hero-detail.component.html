  The word uppercase in the interpolation binding, right after the pipe operator ( | ), 
  activates the built-in UppercasePipe.
  Pipes are a good way to format strings, currency amounts, dates and other display data.

      Here it binds the hero.name property to the HTML textbox so that data can flow in both directions:
      from the hero.name property to the textbox, and from the textbox back to the hero.name.-->
